# AI.md
For the previous task A-CI, I used Codex to perform the work. I found that Codex was able to understand the task and generate code that was mostly correct. However, there were some issues with the code that I had to fix manually. Overall, I think Codex is a powerful tool for generating code, but it still requires human oversight to ensure that the code is correct and efficient. Overall, I would say that the usage of AI enabled me to save roughly 30% of the time it would have taken me to write the code manually. However, I also had to spend some time reviewing and fixing the code generated by Codex, which took additional time.
